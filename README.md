tuff
====

This project is directly inspired by and based on [Tufte
CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and [Acme from Plan
9](http://acme.cat-v.org/).

> Edward Tufte uses a distinctive style in his handouts: simple, with well-set typography, extensive sidenotes, and tight integration of graphics and charts. `tufte-css` brings that style to HTML documents.

Basically, I like the structure of the document and especially the side-notes.

Getting Started
-
To use tuff, just copy `tuff.css` to your project and add the following to your HTML doc's
head block:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="tuff.css">
```

All other files in the repository can be ignored.

Project Scope and Status
-
tuff is specifically a CSS-only solution for styling HTML for the web and print styles are included.

This project is maintained and under active development. Contributions are welcomed especially if they simplify code.

-
